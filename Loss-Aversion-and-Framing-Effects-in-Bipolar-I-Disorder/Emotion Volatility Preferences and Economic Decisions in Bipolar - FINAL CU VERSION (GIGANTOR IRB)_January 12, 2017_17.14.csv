I also took Halcion before each of the two dental procedures.

I also had to take two different antibiotics for a urinary tract infection because the first one, Bactrim, was not one the organism was sensitive to. 

I also took Tylenol extra strength for headaches. I've had two ophthalmic migraines with bizarre sensory prodromes.

I dislocated my symphysis pubis last week and my chiropractor adjusted it.
